# DeformationPaths.jl

A package for approximating continuous motions of geometric constraint systems using Riemannian optimization techniques and homotopy continuation. 

The logo of this package is inspired by the Gough-Stewart platform, which is a body-bar framework that is a popular object of study in numerical algebraic geometry and applied rigidity theory. It has been stylized in the Julia colors.
